\description{
A matrix representing the model space built using all regressors from
the \code{economic_growth} dataset. Therefore the model space contains
\code{2^9 = 512} models (columns). This model space generates Posterior
Inclusion Probabilities which are consistent with the results presented by
Moral-Benito. The original results were approximated up to the 4th decimal
place. The results obtained using this model space lead to exactly the same
approximations.
