\title{Graphs of the prior and posterior model probabilities for the best individual models}
\arguments{
\item{bma_list}{bma_list object (the result of the bma function)}

\item{top}{The number of the best model to be placed on the graphs}
}
\value{
A list with three graphs with prior and posterior model probabilities for individual models:\cr
\enumerate{
\item The results with binomial model prior (based on PMP - posterior model probability) \cr
\item The results with binomial-beta model prior (based on PMP - posterior model probability) \cr
\item On graph combining the aforementioned graphs
}
}
\description{
This function draws four graphs of prior and posterior model probabilities for the best individual models: \cr
a) The results with binomial model prior (based on PMP - posterior model probability) \cr
b) The results with binomial-beta model prior (based on PMP - posterior model probability) \cr
Models on the graph are ordered according to their posterior model probability.
