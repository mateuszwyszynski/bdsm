\subsection{\code{small_model_space}}{

A list with two objects.
\describe{
\item{model space}{
A double matrix with 40 rows and 8 columns with the
parameters for the model space built using subset of the regressors from
the \code{economic_growth} dataset. The included regressors are
\code{ish}, \code{sed} and \code{pgrw}. Therefore the model space
contains \code{2^3 = 8} models (columns).
}
\item{likelihood summmary}{
A matrix representing the summary of likelihoods computed with
\code{compute_model_space_stats} based on the model space. The first row
contains likelihoods for the models. The second row are almost
1/2 * BIC_k as in Raftery's Bayesian Model Selection in Social Research,
eq. 19. The rows 3-7 are standard deviations. Finally, the rows 8-12 are
robust standard deviations

\description{
