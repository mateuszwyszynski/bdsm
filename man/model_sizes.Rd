\title{Graphs of the prior and posterior model probabilities of the model sizes}
\arguments{
\item{bma_list}{bma_list object (the result of the bma function)}
}
\value{
A list with three graphs with prior and posterior model probabilities for model sizes:\cr
\enumerate{
\item The results with binomial model prior (based on PMP - posterior model probability) \cr
\item The results with binomial-beta model prior (based on PMP - posterior model probability) \cr
\item One graph combining all the aforementioned graphs
}
}
\description{
This function draws four graphs of prior and posterior model probabilities: \cr
a) The results with binomial model prior (based on PMP - posterior model probability) \cr
b) The results with binomial-beta model prior (based on PMP - posterior model probability)
