Description: Implements methods for building and analyzing models based on panel
    data as described in the paper by 
    Moral-Benito (2013, <doi:10.1080/07350015.2013.818003>).
    The package provides functions to estimate dynamic panel data models
    and analyze the results of the estimation.
