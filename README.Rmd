## Overview

The **bdsm** package implements Bayesian model averaging (BMA)
for dynamic panels with weakly exogenous regressors,
following the methodology of [Moral-Benito (2016)](#references).
This addresses both:

1. **Model uncertainty** (selecting among many candidate regressors),
2. **Reverse causality** (weak exogeneity, which permits current values of
regressors to correlate with past shocks and other regressors).

The package features:

- Tools to **estimate** the entire model space (via maximum likelihood)
and calculate **Bayesian information criterion (BIC)** for each variant.
- Flexible **model priors** (binomial, binomial-beta, optional dilution prior).
- Comprehensive **BMA statistics**, including posterior inclusion probabilities
(PIPs), posterior means, and posterior standard deviations (regular or robust).
- Functions to **visualize** prior and posterior model probabilities.
- **Jointness measures** for pairs of regressors,
indicating whether they are complements or substitutes.
- Support for **parallel computing** to handle large model spaces.


## Installation

You can install the released version of bdsm from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("bdsm")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mateuszwyszynski/bdsm")
```

Once installed, simply load the package:

```r
library(bdsm)
```


## Getting Started

### Data Preparation

Your data should be in the following format:

1. A **time** column (e.g., `year`),
2. An **entity** column (e.g., `country`),
3. A **dependent variable** column (the variable of interest, e.g. `gdp`),
4. Remaining columns as potential **regressors**.

A convenience function `join_lagged_col()` can help transform a dataset
that already contains both a variable
and its lagged version into the required format.

You can also use `feature_standardization()` to perform mean-centering,
demeaning (entity/time effects), or scaling (standardization) as needed.
For example:

```{r}
library(magrittr)

set.seed(20)

# Features are scaled and demeaned,
# then centralized around the mean within cross-sections (fixed time effects)
data_prepared <- bdsm::economic_growth[, 1:5] %>%
  bdsm::feature_standardization(
    excluded_cols = c(country, year, gdp)
  ) %>%
  bdsm::feature_standardization(
    group_by_col  = year,
    excluded_cols = country,
    scale         = FALSE
  )
```


### Estimating the Model Space

The function `find_model_space()` estimates all possible models
(each possible subset of regressors) via maximum likelihood,
storing the results in a list object.
For small to moderately sized datasets:

```{r}
model_space <- bdsm::find_model_space(
  df             = data_prepared,
  dep_var_col    = gdp,      # Dependent variable
  timestamp_col  = year,
  entity_col     = country,
  init_value     = 0.5,
)
```

For larger datasets, you can leverage multiple cores:

```{r}
library(parallel)

# Choose an appropriate number of cores, taking into account system-level limits
cores <- as.integer(Sys.getenv("_R_CHECK_LIMIT_CORES_", unset = NA))
if (is.na(cores)) {
  cores <- detectCores()
} else {
  cores <- min(cores, detectCores())
}
cl <- makeCluster(cores)

model_space <- bdsm::find_model_space(
  df             = data_prepared,
  timestamp_col  = year,
  entity_col     = country,
  dep_var_col    = gdp,
  init_value     = 0.5,
  cl             = cl
)

stopCluster(cl)
```

A progress bar is displayed to easily track the ongoing computation.

### Performing Bayesian Model Averaging

After preparing the model space,
run `bma()` to obtain posterior model probabilities,
posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs), and other BMA statistics
under the **binomial** and **binomial-beta** model priors:

```{r}
bma_results <- bdsm::bma(model_space, df = data_prepared, round = 3)

# Inspect the BMA summary (binomial prior results first, binomial-beta second)
bma_results[[1]]  # BMA stats under binomial prior
bma_results[[2]]  # BMA stats under binomial-beta prior

# Posterior model sizes:
bma_results[[16]]
```

Key columns in the BMA output include:
- **PIP**: Posterior inclusion probability for each regressor.
- **PM**: Posterior mean of each parameter (averaged over all models).
- **PSD/PSDR**: Posterior standard deviations (regular/robust) of each parameter
- **%(+)**: Percentage of models (among those that include a given regressor)
in which the parameter estimate is positive.

### Visualizing Prior and Posterior Probabilities

1. **`model_pmp()`**: Shows prior vs. posterior model probabilities,
ranking models from best to worst.
2. **`model_sizes()`**: Displays how prior vs. posterior probabilities mass
is distributed across different model sizes.

```{r}
# Plot prior vs. posterior model probabilities
pmp_graphs <- bdsm::model_pmp(bma_results, top = 3)  # Show top 3 models

# Plot probabilities by model size
size_graphs <- bdsm::model_sizes(bma_results)
```

### Selecting the Best Models

Use `best_models()` to extract specific information about the top-ranked models:

```{r}
# Retrieve the 5 best models according to binomial prior
top3_binom <- bdsm::best_models(bma_results, criterion = 1, best = 3)

# Print the inclusion matrix for each of the top 3 models
top3_binom[[1]]

# Retrieve robust standard errors in a knit-friendly table
top3_binom[[6]]
```

### Jointness Measures

Assess whether two regressors tend to co-occur (complements)
or exclude each other (substitutes) using `jointness()`.
By default, it calculates the Hofmarcher et al. (2018) measure:

```{r}
joint_measures <- bdsm::jointness(bma_results)
head(joint_measures)
```

You can also specify older measures,
such as `"LS"` (Ley & Steel) or `"DW"` (Doppelhofer & Weeks):

```{r}
joint_measures_ls <- bdsm::jointness(bma_results, measure = "LS")
```

## Example

Below is a minimal reproducible workflow:

```{r}
# 1) Data preparation
data_prepared <- bdsm::economic_growth[, 1:5] %>%
  bdsm::feature_standardization(
    excluded_cols = c(country, year, gdp)
  ) %>%
  bdsm::feature_standardization(
    group_by_col  = year,
    excluded_cols = country,
    scale         = FALSE
  )

# 2) Estimate model space
prep_obj <- bdsm::find_model_space(
  df            = data_prepared,
  dep_var_col   = gdp,
  timestamp_col = year,
  entity_col    = country,
  init_value     = 0.5,
)

# 3) Run Bayesian Model Averaging
bma_obj <- bdsm::bma(
  for_bma = prep_obj,
  df      = data_prepared
)

# 4) Inspect the top 3 models under binomial prior
best_3 <- bdsm::best_models(
  bma_list = bma_obj,
  criterion = 1,
  best = 3
)
best_3[[1]]  # Inclusion table
best_3[[2]]  # Coefficients & standard errors
```


## Troubleshooting

1. Cannot install required packages / setup renv environment

Make sure to go through the displayed errors.
The problem might be connected to your OS environment.
E.g. you might see an information like the following:

```
Configuration failed to find one of freetype2 libpng libtiff-4 libjpeg. Try installing:
 * deb: libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
 * rpm: freetype-devel libpng-devel libtiff-devel libjpeg-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
 * csw: libfreetype_dev libpng16_dev libtiff_dev libjpeg_dev (Solaris)
```

In such case you should first try installing the recommended packages.
With properly configured system environment everything should work fine.
